## 🔍 About Me

I'm transitioning from an 8-year academic career as an Assistant Professor specializing in **linear algebra**, **statistics**, and **machine learning**, into a data science role in industry.

With a Ph.D. in Mathematics and an M.S. in Analytics from Georgia Tech, I combine **deep theoretical knowledge** with **hands-on experience** in:

- NLP (Transformers, Hugging Face, LangChain, OpenAI API)
- Computer Vision (CNNs, YOLO)
- Predictive Modeling for Finance
- Statistical Computing & Visualization

My research and applied projects reflect a commitment to using data-driven methods to solve impactful real-world problems.
